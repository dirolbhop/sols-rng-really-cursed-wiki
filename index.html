        <div class="left">The main objective of the game is to get Auras. Auras are obtained by rolling for them. They vary in design and chance, being much more detailed and impressive the rarer they get. Some auras are biome-specific, having a greater chance of obtaining that aura when a certain biome is present. Outside the biome, the aura can still be obtained, though at a rarer chance. This system is called Breakthrough. Specific auras can have mutations, which are different, albeit rarer versions of an aura, with a similar design although tweaked and recolored. These mutations usually have an identifier showing which aura it is mutated from (like Exotic · APEX), while others do not (like KROMAT1K).

            When an aura’s rarity is over 1,000, the aura will play a unique cutscene to go along with it. Also, it will appear in the chat.
            
            When an aura’s rarity is over 10,000, the aura will play a unique cutscene, involving a star. This will also appear in the chat.
            
            As of Era 8, there are a total of 102 auras in-game (121, if including developer exclusive). Of those auras:
            
            96 of them are permanent
            30 can be obtained via breakthroughs
            25 are mutations (24, if including developer exclusive)
            1 of them is craftable
            8 of them are limited
            27 of them are unobtainable/developer exclusive</div>

        <div class="left">    <h1>items in sols rng</h1>
            <p>Items are important for rolling better auras, as they are the only way to gain a luck boost apart from the obby and Effects. Some items, such as Lucky Potions, can be found on the map spawning every so often. Other items, such as Exo Gauntlet, can be crafted using auras. Depending on the effect given by these items, the auras may be harder to obtain. There are also developer/admin-only items that are unobtainable.Items can spawn in eight different locations around the map. These locations are highlighted in the image above. The area currently known to have the highest spawn rate is the brown mountain on the far right of the photo, as it contains the largest number of spawn locations for consumables.
        
                Inside the house.
                Under the tree to the bottom right side of the house.
                Behind the "Donations!" Board
                Between the "Most Rolled" leaderboard and the update log.
                Under the tree closest to Jake's Workshop.
                Under the tree bottom left to the mine.
                On top of the brown mine leading to Stella's Portal.
                After the tree obby, inside the small cave.
                Items will spawn at any of these locations every 20 seconds. A Lucky Potion has a 1/42 chance to spawn, and a Speed Potion has a 1/100 chance. Stella's Star will only spawn during the Starfall biome, with a 1/20 chance. Any of the Biome-Exclusive items will spawn at the start of the biome that it corresponds to. However, some people are unable to find those items because they are not in the select biome. These items always spawn at the start of the biome change.</p></div>

        <div class="left">    <h2>effects in sols rng</h2>
            <p>Effects can be gained from various different means such as Potions and Gears/Items and can currently only boost the player's roll cooldown and luck. Effects can stack, meaning if the player uses a Lucky Potion twice, it will have double the duration but will keep the same +100% luck. Meanwhile, Potions of the same effect but with different levels cannot stack with each other. Some examples like this are Fortune Potions.</p></div>

        <div class="left">    <h3>biome,weather,time in sols rng</h3>
            <p>The Biomes/Weather/Time system is comprised of a pack of unique events that visually apply to the map and affect the chance of obtaining exclusive auras for that biome. The system operates similarly to the rolling system used by players to acquire auras, but instead, it is rolled every second. For instance, if the Starfall biome has a 1 in 7,500 chance of appearing, then every second, the system will "roll" to determine if the Starfall biome should appear or not.
        
                Currently, there are 6 biomes as of Era 7 (Normal, Hell, Starfall, Corruption, Null and Glitched) and 3 weathers (Windy, Snowy, and Rainy) in the game. Time is not included due to it being its own separate system.
                
                When a biome or weather spawns, players will be alerted in the chat, notifying them about which biome has spawned.
                
                Breakthrough
                Most auras (excluding Glitch & Oppression due to them being glitched biome exclusives) can also be obtained outside of their natural biome through a system known as breakthrough. Each biome has a respective multiplier, which increases the rarity of biome auras if their native biome is present. For example, rolling an ABYSSAL HUNTER with Rainy active would have its rarity at 1/100,000,000, while its rarity in any other biome is increased to 1/400,000,000. The biome multipliers are 3x for Windy, 3x for Snowy, 4x for Rainy, 5x for Corruption, 6x for Hell, 10x for Starfall, 1000x for Null, and none for Glitch (as it reunites every multiplier from every event). In Era 7, the definition of "breakthrough" was changed so that breakthroughs are now getting auras at a lower chance inside a specific biome.</p></div>

            <p>NPCs are non-player characters with whom the player can interact to receive quests or craft items. Currently, there are 5 NPCs (One of which is leaked) in the game: Lime, Jake, Stella, Mari, and Jester. The Miner is the leaked character, and does not have an official name yet.
        
                For more information about each NPC, read their respective articles.</p></div>

            <p>Lime
                Lime
                Lime is a female NPC. She has yellow skin, black hair, a white hoodie with a black, cat-themed pocket and a black hood, and black stockings.

                Jake headshot
                Jake is a presumed male NPC who is the owner of Jake’s Workshop. He is a noob with a black top hat that has a slightly lighter dark gray band. The top hat that he wears is called "Rbadam's Smokestack Top Hat".
                
                Stella
                Stella.pngg
                Stella is a female NPC who lives within a cave accessed through parkour or through the Portal (after completing her quest). She is a human with a witch outfit, yellow eyes and white hair.
                
                Mari
                Mari npc1
                Mari is a female NPC who spawns randomly on the map at different times. She can be interacted with, similar to Jake, and sells a variety of potions for coins. Her appearance is that of the leak and looks like an adventurer. Mari will leave after 3 minutes, so be quick when buying her products!
                
                Jester
                Jester NPC
                Jester is a male NPC who also spawns randomly like Mari at a random time. He can be interacted and sells runes, exclusive potions, exchanges biome exclusive items and more for some Dark points, or P for short.</p></div>
